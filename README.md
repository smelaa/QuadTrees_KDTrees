# QuadTress and KDTrees
A project for Computational Geometry course. \
\
We implemented such data structures as QuadTrees and KDTrees to fast search points in 2D ranges. Then we tested and comapared their speed including construction and searching. We prepared visualisation of the algorithms using provided graphic tool.\
\
In those documents (both in Polish) we explained how the structures work and how they were implemented, how to use our work and what are the results of our tests:
